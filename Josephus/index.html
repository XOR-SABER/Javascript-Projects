                Josephus Problem:
            </h1>
            <p>
                <strong>
                    Context:
                </strong>

                Basically, This problem is a descrete math problem. 
                Here's some context, so there's these jewish soldiers and basically they want to off themselves.
                However they can't, because some old textbook told them not to, so they get in a circle and kill each other like rational people.
                With one knight being the start, and then skiping a certain amount of times. With the last knight having to off themselves.
                BUT, Josephus was a rational person and prefered being captured. So to avoid being that one guy, he needs to find a place to be at.
                To be the last one standing.
